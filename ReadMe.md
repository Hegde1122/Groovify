## Responsiveness Strategy

- Utilized **Flexbox layout** to arrange and reflow elements on different screen sizes.
- Integrated **media queries** for adaptive design (stacking cards, hiding sidebar).
- Used **relative units** like `%`, `em`, and `vh/vw` for flexible sizing.
- Ensured scrollable content with customized scrollbars (WebKit + Firefox support).

## Key JavaScript Concepts Used

- `querySelector` and DOM traversal
- Event handling (`addEventListener`)
- Basic callback pattern
- Optionally: `Audio()` API for song playback
- Toggle-based UI updates (like play/pause)

---

## What Makes This Stand Out?

- Clean and modern UI that mirrors Spotifyâ€™s layout
- Real-world front-end interview concepts (DOM, responsiveness, JS interactivity)
- Designed with scalability â€” easy to add playlists, music, authentication, etc.
- Fully functional prototype with **zero frameworks** (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real song playback using `Audio` API
- Add search functionality
- Connect to Spotify API for real-time music
- User authentication (login/signup)
- Like, queue, and playlist management
